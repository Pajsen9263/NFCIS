# First Boot 
When you first boot the system you will be greeted with setup application. The application will allow you to choose the maingateway, admin code and interface name. 

## Maingateway config
For the system to work (unless you have the standalone system) you will need to connect to the Maingateway. 
You will be asked to enter the IP, username and password of the Maingateway. The IP, username and password can all be found on the maingateway page (http://nfcismgw.local). 


## Admin code
The setup will ask you to create a 8 diget code for the admin panel
All physical interfaces requires a 8 diget code for admin access. The code shoud be entered after clicking on the "code" text 3 times. 
The admin code will allow you to enter admin mode. The admin mode includes debug settings and configs. 
The admin code is also used for the remote remote config page. 

## Interface name
The interface name is a unique name used for the device. The interface name will be shown on the maingateway admin panel and it's also used for remote access to it. All SUI's NEEDS to have unique interface names!




All these settings can be changed using the admin mode or the remote config.
